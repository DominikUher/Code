Welcome to ETS's new routing software!

Select the relevant city, toll, and fleet in the left sidebar.
Choose your preferred first solution strategy (FSS), local search strategy (LSS), and time limit [sec] via the blue option menus.
Generate routes with the green button in the top left!

All vehicles are assumed to be available for routes twice per day, which is why the solution may use up to double the vehicles chosen.
